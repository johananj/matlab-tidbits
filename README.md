# matlab-tidbits
Useful matlab code tidbits for everyday use.

Using multiple languages, most of the time, code gets jumbled in my head, as it must be for everyone.
Grepping through old code is the usual method.
Tried gists, but it doesn't serve the purpose. 
I thought I would create a repository instead.
